# 100DaysOfSwiftUI

It's fall 2023 and I'm giving a go at this course again. I'll be bundling several course-days of 100DaysOfSwiftUI into physical days.

### SwiftUI Day 1: simple data types

#### Variables, constants, strings, and numbers

##### Why learn Swift?

- It's a relatively young language with little cruft, built on the successes of other languages.
- Swift is a modern (2014) general-purpose type-safe compiled programming language, developed by Apple and the open-source community, as a replacement for (while interoperating with) Objective-C. It is designed to be "Safe, Fast, and Expressive."
- Swift makes it harder to write unsafe code; and easier to write clear, understandable code.

##### Variable Conventions

- prefer constants over variables when possible for optimization, control, and to avoid mistakes
- By convention, prefer camelCase for variable or constant naming style

### Built
- Playground1
