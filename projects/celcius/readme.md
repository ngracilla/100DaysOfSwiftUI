# Project Celcius

## Objectives

- A series of apps that help users to better conceptualize the relationship between Farenheit and Celcius.

## Concepts

- an apple watch version that uses the crown to change the temperature
- a color sequence that moves from hot red to cold blue
- a dominant temperature display, with the alt smaller, to the right and bottom
- tap on the secondary format to make it primary, and "switch" the large vs. small version
- a game where you guess temperatures
