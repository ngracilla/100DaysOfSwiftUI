// Before the rehabilitation program, patients with long-term COVID had over 30 points. After the study, participants no longer experienced severe fatigue. â€œSo when we say we improved by five points, what we mean is that it came down five points," Daynes says. "The higher the score, the worse their fatigue. Anything above 30 would be severe."
